# BiCS-SWIM-system
# Description
We at Bio-insprired Ciruit and Systems Lab at ArizonaStateUniversity have developed an open-source Standalone Wireless Impedance Matching (SWIM) system for RF coils in MRI. We used a modular design approach to make it easy to scale the system to multiple channels or change the operating frequency according to field strength.
